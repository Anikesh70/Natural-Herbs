  <p>1. Shikakai Hair Cleanser:<br>

    Mix powdered Shikakai with water to form a paste or a thin consistency.<br>
    Apply this paste to wet hair and gently massage it into the scalp.<br>
    Leave it on for a few minutes to allow it to cleanse the scalp and hair.<br>
    Rinse thoroughly with water. You can follow up with a conditioner if needed.</p>
<p>2. Shikakai Hair Rinse:<br>

    Boil a handful of Shikakai pods or powder in water for about 15-20 minutes.<br>
    Let the mixture cool down and strain out the liquid.<br>
    Use this Shikakai-infused water as a final rinse after shampooing your hair.<br>
    Massage it into your scalp and hair, then rinse thoroughly with water.</p>
<p>3. Shikakai Hair Mask:<br>

    Mix Shikakai powder with other hair-friendly ingredients like Amla powder, Brahmi powder, or Yogurt.<br>
    Add a little water to make a paste of medium consistency.<br>
    Apply this hair mask to your scalp and hair, focusing on the roots and ends.<br>
    Leave it on for 30 minutes to an hour, then rinse thoroughly with water.</p>
<p>4. Shikakai Hair Oil Infusion:<br>

    Mix Shikakai powder with a carrier oil like coconut oil, almond oil, or olive oil.<br>
    Place the mixture in a glass jar and let it sit in a sunny spot for a few days to allow the oil to absorb the herbal properties.<br>
    Strain out the Shikakai powder, and your herbal-infused oil is ready to use.<br>
    Massage this oil into your scalp and hair, leave it on for at least an hour or overnight, then shampoo and rinse as usual.</p>
<p>5. Shikakai Hair Pack:<br>

    Mix Shikakai powder with other ingredients like yogurt, honey, or egg to create a nourishing hair pack.<br>
    Apply this pack to your scalp and hair, covering it entirely.<br>
    Leave it on for 30 minutes to an hour, then rinse thoroughly with water.</p>
<p>6. Shikakai Hair Detangler:<br>

    Prepare a Shikakai decoction by boiling Shikakai pods or powder in water.<br>
    Let it cool down and strain out the liquid.<br>
    Pour the Shikakai decoction into a spray bottle and use it as a natural hair detangler and conditioner after washing your hair.</p>
