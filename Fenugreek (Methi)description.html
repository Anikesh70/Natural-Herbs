  <h1>Fenugreek (Methi) Description</h1>
  <p>1. Fenugreek Hair Mask:<br>

    Soak fenugreek seeds overnight in water to soften them.<br>
    Grind the soaked seeds into a fine paste the next day.<br>
    Optionally, you can add other ingredients such as yogurt, coconut milk, aloe vera gel, or honey to enhance the benefits.<br>
    Apply the fenugreek paste to your scalp and hair, focusing on the roots and ends.<br>
    Leave it on for 30 minutes to an hour, then rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water.<br>
    Use this mask once or twice a week to promote hair growth, strengthen hair follicles, and prevent hair loss.</p>
<p>2. Fenugreek Infused Oil:<br>

    Heat a carrier oil such as coconut oil or olive oil in a pan.<br>
    Add fenugreek seeds to the hot oil and let them simmer on low heat for a few minutes until they turn slightly brown.<br>
    Remove from heat and let the oil cool down.<br>
    Strain the oil to remove the fenugreek seeds.<br>
    Transfer the infused oil to a clean bottle or jar.<br>
    Massage the fenugreek-infused oil into your scalp and hair, ensuring thorough coverage.<br>
    Leave it on overnight or for a few hours, then shampoo and condition your hair as usual.<br>
    Regular use of fenugreek-infused oil helps nourish the scalp, strengthen hair roots, and promote shiny, healthy hair.</p>
<p>3. Fenugreek Water Rinse:<br>

    Soak fenugreek seeds in water overnight.<br>
    Strain the seeds and collect the fenugreek-infused water.<br>
    Use this fenugreek water as a final rinse after shampooing your hair.<br>
    Gently massage the fenugreek water into your scalp and hair, focusing on the roots.<br>
    Leave it on for a few minutes, then rinse it out with plain water.<br>
    Fenugreek water helps condition the hair, reduce dandruff, and promote hair growth</p>
<p>4. Fenugreek Hair Paste for Dandruff:<br>

    Grind fenugreek seeds into a fine powder.<br>
    Mix the fenugreek powder with water to form a thick paste.<br>
    Apply the paste to your scalp and massage it gently.<br>
    Leave it on for about 30 minutes, then rinse it out with lukewarm water.<br>
    Use this paste regularly to reduce dandruff, soothe scalp irritation, and maintain scalp health.
