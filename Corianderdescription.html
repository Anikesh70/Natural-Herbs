    elimination of toxins from the body.</p>

    <p>2. Coriander Paste: Grind fresh coriander leaves into a paste and apply it topically to relieve skin

    to alleviate cough and sore throat symptoms.</p>
    
    <p>3. Coriander Seed Infusion: Steep coriander seeds in hot water to create an infusion. This infusion can be 
    used as a gargle to soothe a sore throat or as a mouthwash to freshen breath and combat oral infections.</p>
    
    <p>4. Coriander Essential Oil: Dilute coriander essential oil with a carrier oil such as coconut or olive oil and
