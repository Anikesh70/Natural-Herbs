  <h1>Hibiscus Description</h1>
  <p>1. Hibiscus Hair Oil:<br>

    Method: Crush fresh hibiscus flowers and leaves or use dried hibiscus powder. Mix it with a carrier oil like coconut oil, olive oil, or almond oil in a clean glass jar. Let it infuse for a few days to a week, shaking the jar occasionally. Strain the oil and use it as a hair oil.<br>
    Application: Massage the hibiscus-infused oil onto your scalp and hair. Leave it on for at least an hour or overnight before washing it off with a mild shampoo. Regular use can promote hair growth, strengthen hair follicles, and add shine to the hair.</p>
<p>2. Hibiscus Hair Mask:<br>

    Method: Blend fresh hibiscus flowers and leaves or hibiscus powder with other hair-nourishing ingredients like yogurt, coconut milk, aloe vera gel, or fenugreek seeds to form a smooth paste.<br>
    Application: Apply the hibiscus hair mask to damp hair, focusing on the scalp and roots. Leave it on for 30 minutes to an hour, then rinse it off with water and shampoo. This mask helps in conditioning the hair, preventing hair fall, and improving scalp health.</p>
<p>3. Hibiscus Rinse:<br>

    Method: Boil hibiscus flowers and leaves in water for 10-15 minutes to make a concentrated hibiscus tea. Let it cool and strain out the liquid.<br>
    Application: After shampooing and conditioning your hair, rinse it with the hibiscus tea. Leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing it off with water. This rinse helps in detangling hair, reducing frizz, and adding a natural shine.</p>
<p>4. Hibiscus Hair Serum:<br>

    Method: Mix hibiscus flower extract or hibiscus powder with aloe vera gel and a few drops of essential oils like rosemary or lavender oil.<br>
    Application: Apply a small amount of the hibiscus hair serum to damp or dry hair, focusing on the ends. This serum helps in controlling frizz, adding moisture, and protecting hair from environmental damage.</p>
<p>5. Hibiscus Hair Tea:<br>

    Method: Steep dried hibiscus flowers or hibiscus powder in hot water to make a herbal tea. Let it cool and use it as a final rinse after shampooing and conditioning your hair.<br>
    Application: Pour the hibiscus hair tea over your hair as a final rinse to condition the hair, add shine, and soothe the scalp.</p>
